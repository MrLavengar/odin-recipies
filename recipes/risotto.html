    <p>Simple and hearty butternut squash risotto dish./p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 pound mashed, cooked butternut squash</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons finely shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour broth in a medium saucepan, cover, and heat over medium-low heat until warm, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add rice; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add wine and simmer, stirring constantly, until absorbed, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup warm broth and simmer, stirring frequently, until it is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining broth, adding 1/2 cup at a time and stirring until all broth is absorbed and rice is tender and creamy, about 25 minutes more.</li>
